# Predict-the-Happiness-HackerEarth-Challenge

It uses 2-layered fully connected/Dense Neural network model to predict whether the hotel reviews at TripAdvisor site are positive sentiment or negative sentiment.

Best thing would be to follow my blog-post for implementation. The description about the steps to build the application from scratch can be read from my blog:

It is a python implementation utilizing Keras library for DNN.

This problem statement came from a HackerEarth challenge: "Predict the Happiness"
The accuracy score achieved was 88% when prediction file (sample_submisson.csv) is uploaded to their portal.

The link for corpus/dataset download is given in blog-post.

Having so much of discussion around BERT over internet, I also chose to apply BERT in the same competition in order to prove if tuning BERT model can take me to the top of leader board of the challenge. Here is the blog-post show casing the step by step process of using pre-trained BERT model which took me to RANK 4 in the leaderboard.
