# Predict-the-Happiness-HackerEarth-Challenge

It uses 2-layered fully connected/Dense Neural network model to predict whether the hotel reviews at TripAdvisor site are positive sentiment or negative sentiment.

Best thing would be to follow my blog-post for implementation. The description about the steps to build the application from scratch can be read from my blog:

https://appliedmachinelearning.wordpress.com/2017/12/21/predict-the-happiness-on-tripadvisor-reviews-using-dense-neural-network-with-keras-hackerearth-challenge/

It is a python implementation utilizing Keras library for DNN.

This problem statement came from a HackerEarth challenge: "Predict the Happiness"
The accuracy score achieved was 88% when prediction file (sample_submisson.csv) is uploaded to their portal.

The link for corpus/dataset download is given in blog-post.
